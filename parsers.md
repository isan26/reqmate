The `fetch` API in JavaScript is used to make HTTP requests and receive responses. The type of response can vary based on what you're requesting and how the server is configured to respond. Here are some common types of responses you might encounter:

### JSON Response

A very common type of response. The server returns a JSON-formatted string which you can then parse into a JavaScript object using `response.json()`.

```javascript
fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

### Text Response

Sometimes, you'll just get plain text back. You can handle this with `response.text()`.

```javascript
fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(text => console.log(text));
```

### HTML Response

For web pages, the server often returns HTML content. You can also treat this as text and use `response.text()` to handle it.

```javascript
fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(html => console.log(html));
```

### XML or Other Data Formats

XML can be parsed similarly to text. After receiving it, you may want to use the DOMParser to convert it to an XML DOM object for easier manipulation.

```javascript
fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(str => new DOMParser().parseFromString(str, "application/xml"))
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

### Blob and Binary Data

If you're dealing with binary data like images, audio files, or other media, you can use `response.blob()`.

```javascript
fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.blob())
  .then(blob => {
    const img = document.createElement('img');
    img.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    document.body.appendChild(img);
  });
```

### Array Buffer

For even more control over binary data, you might use `response.arrayBuffer()`.

```javascript
fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.arrayBuffer())
  .then(buffer => {
    // Do something with the array buffer
  });
```

### Streaming Response

For large files or streaming data, you can use `response.body`, which is a ReadableStream, to process the data as it arrives.

```javascript
const reader = response.body.getReader();
```

### HTTP Status Codes

Apart from the data format, also pay attention to the HTTP status code in the response object to determine the outcome of the HTTP request (e.g., `200` for success, `404` for not found, `500` for server error, etc.).

```javascript
fetch(url)
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.log('Fetch error:', error));
```

Remember that `fetch` only rejects a promise on network failure or if anything prevented the request from completing. Otherwise, it will resolve normally (even on HTTP 404 or 500), and you'll have to use `response.ok` to check if the response was successful.
